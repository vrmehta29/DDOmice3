WARNING: The NVIDIA Driver was not detected.  GPU functionality will not be available.
   Use 'nvidia-docker run' to start this container; see
   https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki/nvidia-docker .

ERROR: Detected MOFED driver 5.0-0, but this container has version 4.4-1.0.0.
       Unable to automatically upgrade this container.
       Use of RDMA for multi-node communication will be unreliable.

NOTE: MOFED driver was detected, but nv_peer_mem driver was not detected.
      Multi-node communication performance may be reduced.
